Artificial intelligence has become the holy grail of modern technology. The recent structures based on neural networks are simple yet shockingly effective. Since 2015, deep computer vision has granted robots sharper eyes than common human beings, and Microsoft [Xiaoice](http://www.msxiaoice.com/), an emotional chat-bot developed with deep learning, has talked with millions of people in China. 

Despite these impressive applications, neural networks in AI are just mocking neuron connection inside our own brains, and they also resemble human beings in how they develope skills. Researchers have designed AIs that recognize objects better than human, while the state-of-the-art AI can talk for a few minutes without getting noticed, and we are far from any meaningful excerpts of writing generated by AI. Similarly, consider how a child learns to see, to talk, and finally to write. Tasks that are hard to children are equally hard to AI's. Put philosophical implications aside, we are intrigued to further compare children and AI: for example, have we focused too much on teaching AI's "at school"?

## AI who goes to school

From fancy self-driving Tesla to credit card fraud detection, modern AI are prevalent and variant. However, so far they are all trained and stored on the humongous servers buzzing somewhere in the Silicon Valley. Whenever you pick up your phone or start your car, you are accessing the AI's far away, or downloading a copy of it onto your device. You also accept the terms and conditions that grant these AI's your personal information to improve their performance. Such AI's are born to learn in the school of servers: they are fed in structured data like textbooks, and follow the programmer's teaching to generate expected results. In fact, computer scientists also use terminology adopted from school education: supervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc.
