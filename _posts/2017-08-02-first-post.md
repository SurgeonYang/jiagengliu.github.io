## A blog of random thinking
I occasionally answer some questions on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/jiagengliu), but find it restraining myself in the scope of people who ask the questions and the community of native Chinese. Inspired by [Professor Amini](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~arash.amini) and [Ze Yang](https://yangze.tech), I have set up a personal website through [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and take notes of some random thinking and day-dreaming.
